<h1><i><u>Introduction</i></u></h1><br>
<div align = "center">Get Set Goal is an Ultimate Squad Management System which will allow users to easily access any Team’s or Player’s profile and statistics. This management system will be designed in such a way that it will allow administrators to create, update and delete player profiles and statistics whereas the front-end users can only view the data. Basically, this system allows managers to create their own dream football team according to a player’s position, i.e. Forwarder, Mid-Fielder, Defense and So on. It allows users to search for players via name as well as their playing position. Users can check out player’s details, history, and statistics. Goals, assists, cards and achievement are included in the statistics. 
 
Along with this, a secure login and registration page will be a key functionality of our squad management system. Once the user registers, his/her data will be stored in our database which later can be used as the user’s login credentials. Once the user successfully logs in to the squad management system, he/she will be able to access the system’s frontend.

Tkinter is included with standard Linux, Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X installs of Python. The name Tkinter comes from Tk interface. </li>
<li><b>Pytest </b>:&nbsp;PyTest is a testing framework that allows users to write test codes using Python programming language. It helps you to write simple and scalable test cases for databases, APIs, or UI. PyTest is mainly used for writing tests for APIs. It helps to write tests from simple unit tests to complex functional tests.</li>
 <li><b>Text-to-Speech </b>:&nbsp;Text-to-speech (TTS) technology reads aloud digital text — the words on computers, smartphones, and tablets. TTS can help people who struggle with reading.</li>
